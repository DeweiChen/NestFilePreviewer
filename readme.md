Generating an Index Web Page for Retrieving Images from Nested Folders

## Objective
The goal is to create an index web page that can retrieve images from nested folders, providing an easy reference for future use.

## Description
We aim to develop a solution that scans through all nested folders, collects images, and generates an index web page for convenient access and reference.

## Implementation
1. We will create a script to recursively search through all nested folders.
2. The script will identify image files within these folders.
3. For each image found, we will generate HTML code to display it.
4. The HTML code will be organized into an index web page.
5. This web page will serve as a visual reference for all images in the nested folders.

## Benefits
- Provides an organized and easily accessible index of images.
- Streamlines the process of locating and referencing images.
- Enhances productivity by eliminating the need to manually search through folders.

## Usage
To generate the index web page for your images, run the provided script. Simply specify the root folder where your nested folders containing images are located. The script will do the rest, creating an HTML index page for your convenience.

## Example
```bash
./generate_index.sh
